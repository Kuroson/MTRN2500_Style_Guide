# Webots Source Files

Updated 25 Sep 2021

These are the hpp and cpp files provided by Webots 2021b for your reference.

You can also find these files in the folders installed by Webots on your computer.

  * The hpp files can be found in "...\Webots\include\controller\cpp\webots";

  * The cpp files can be found in "...\Webots\src\controller\cpp";

  * In the paths above, ... is where your Webots program has been installed.

Note: The style of the Webots hpp and cpp files may not follow what has been recommended in MTRN2500.
      It is mainly because most of the files were started many years ago, and updating them to the
      modern standards require lots of effort.
      We require you to follow the style requirements of this course when implementing your own programs.
